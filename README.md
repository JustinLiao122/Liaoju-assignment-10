Use command make install 
to set up env and installs all the required packages 

Use command make run 
to run the web app on local host

Use command make clean 
to clean up envoriment

I will say the make install take a bit of time as it needs to insall open-clip-tourch which has a lot of dependecies that need to be install as well.

This is the youtube video link of the web app: https://youtu.be/HjE_08TC4oE
It can also be found on my website.

I would also like to note that the coco_images_resized folder of all the images are not included. I was unable to push it to this repo. For set up besure to have the coco_images_resized folder in the same directory as the app.py. Also it should be structed like this coco_images_resized/coco_images_resized/all the images... This way web app is able to pull the images correctly.
