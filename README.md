Use command make install 
to set up env and installs all the required packages 

Use command make run 
to run the web app on local host

Use command make clean 
to clean up envoriment

I will say the make install take a bit of time as it needs to insall open-clip-tourch which has a lot of dependecies that need to be install as well.

This is the youtube video link of the web app: https://youtu.be/HjE_08TC4oE
